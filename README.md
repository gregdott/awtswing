# awtswing
Simple graphic examples with AWT & Swing in Java

## Notes:

This was made as a Maven project in case I expand it further and need to include some or another dependency. For now though (as of 12-11-2022) there are no dependencies, so it does not need to be used as a Maven project. You can find the relevant files in [awtswing/src/main/java/](https://github.com/gregdott/awtswing/tree/main/awtswing/src/main/java/com/awtswing). The most important file at present is GraphicsPanel.java. That's where all the meat is for now.

## What can it do?

Right now this project just contains some basic examples of drawing and moving shapes using AWT and Swing in Java. I'll add a more detailed description here at some point. This aims to be a nice resource for easily understanding how to draw, move and manipulate shapes without having to scour Stackoverlow for 10 different things. This is still a work in progress.
